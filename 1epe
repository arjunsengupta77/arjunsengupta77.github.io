EPE stands for Expected Positive Exposure. It is a risk management term used to measure the potential future exposure of a financial instrument, such as a derivative, under normal market conditions.

EPE estimates the average value of a contract or position that is expected to be positive over a certain period of time, reflecting the potential for future profits, but also potential risk. It's a key metric in assessing counterparty credit risk, especially in derivative markets, as it helps in calculating the potential exposure to a counterparty at a future point in time.

This is often used alongside other measures like Expected Negative Exposure (ENE) and Potential Future Exposure (PFE).
