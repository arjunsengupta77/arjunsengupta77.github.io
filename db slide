Got it! Here's the updated version of your presentation, adding a slide titled "What is a Database?":


---

Session 1: SQL Fundamentals


---

Slide 1: What is a Database?

Definition: A database is a structured collection of data stored and accessed electronically. It is designed to store, manage, and retrieve data efficiently.

Purpose: The goal of a database is to provide a centralized location where data can be stored, organized, and accessed, making it easier to retrieve, manipulate, and update data.

Key Features:

Data Integrity: Ensures the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle.

Data Security: Provides mechanisms to restrict unauthorized access.

Data Redundancy: Minimizes data duplication.

Data Querying: Allows users to retrieve data with ease using queries (e.g., SQL).


Example: A database for a bank might store information about customers, accounts, transactions, and loans.



---

Slide 2: Types of Databases

Relational Databases (RDBMS): Store data in tables (rows and columns).

Example: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server


Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL): Store data in formats other than tables.

Example: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis




---

Slide 3: Basic SQL Statements

SELECT: Retrieve data from a database.

Syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;


INSERT INTO: Add data to a table.

Syntax: INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2);


UPDATE: Modify existing data.

Syntax: UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition;


DELETE: Remove data from a table.

Syntax: DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;




---

Slide 4: Grouping Data

GROUP BY: Organizes rows into groups based on a shared column value.

Example: Count the number of loans per customer.

SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_loans
FROM loans
GROUP BY customer_id;



---

Slide 5: Ordering Data

ORDER BY: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.

Syntax: SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1 [ASC|DESC];

Example: Sorting customers by loan amount:

SELECT customer_name, loan_amount
FROM loans
ORDER BY loan_amount DESC;



---

Slide 6: Filtering Data

WHERE: Filters data based on specified conditions.

Common operators: =, >, <, >=, <=, <>, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN.

Example: Find loans greater than 1 million.

SELECT loan_id, loan_amount
FROM loans
WHERE loan_amount > 1000000;



---

Slide 7: Joins in SQL

What is a JOIN?

JOIN: Combines rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

Joins help retrieve related data from multiple tables in a single query.



---

Slide 8: Types of Joins

1. INNER JOIN

Definition: Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

Example: Get customer names and their loan amounts.

SELECT customers.customer_name, loans.loan_amount
FROM customers
INNER JOIN loans ON customers.customer_id = loans.customer_id;


2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)

Definition: Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table. If no match, NULL is returned from the right table.

Example: Get all customers and their loans, even if they have no loans.

SELECT customers.customer_name, loans.loan_amount
FROM customers
LEFT JOIN loans ON customers.customer_id = loans.customer_id;


3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)

Definition: Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table. If no match, NULL is returned from the left table.

Example: Get all loans and their corresponding customers, even if no customer is associated with a loan.

SELECT customers.customer_name, loans.loan_amount
FROM customers
RIGHT JOIN loans ON customers.customer_id = loans.customer_id;


4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)

Definition: Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. If no match, NULL is returned for the missing side.

Example: Get all customers and loans, even if they don't have a match.

SELECT customers.customer_name, loans.loan_amount
FROM customers
FULL OUTER JOIN loans ON customers.customer_id = loans.customer_id;


5. CROSS JOIN

Definition: Returns the Cartesian product of both tables, i.e., every combination of rows from the two tables.

Example: Get all combinations of customers and loans.

SELECT customers.customer_name, loans.loan_amount
FROM customers
CROSS JOIN loans;

Slide 9: Aggregate Functions in SQL

What are Aggregate Functions?

Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single value.

Common Aggregate Functions:

COUNT(): Returns the number of rows.

SUM(): Returns the sum of a numeric column.

AVG(): Returns the average value of a numeric column.

MAX(): Returns the maximum value of a column.

MIN(): Returns the minimum value of a column.



Example of Aggregate Functions:

COUNT(): Find the total number of loans.

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_loans
FROM loans;

SUM(): Find the total loan amount.

SELECT SUM(loan_amount) AS total_loan_value
FROM loans;

AVG(): Find the average loan amount.

SELECT AVG(loan_amount) AS avg_loan_value
FROM loans;

MAX(): Find the largest loan amount.

SELECT MAX(loan_amount) AS max_loan_value
FROM loans;

MIN(): Find the smallest loan amount.

SELECT MIN(loan_amount) AS min_loan_value
FROM loans;

Slide 10: Recap of Key SQL Concepts

SELECT: Retrieve data.

INSERT INTO: Add data.

UPDATE: Modify data.

DELETE: Remove data.

GROUP BY: Aggregate data.

ORDER BY: Sort data.

WHERE: Filter data.

JOIN: Combine data from multiple tables.

Aggregate Functions: Perform calculations on data.

Slide 11: Q&A and Next Steps

Q&A: Open for questions on the first session.

Next Session: Dive deeper into advanced SQL concepts like subqueries, complex joins, and nested queries.
