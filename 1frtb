The Trading Book–Banking Book boundary was a key weakness in the old Basel II framework. Under FRTB, this boundary is significantly tightened to reduce regulatory arbitrage. Here's the comparison:


---

Old Framework (Pre-FRTB)

Vague criteria: Banks had more discretion to choose whether a position belonged to the trading or banking book.

Regulatory arbitrage: Banks could place riskier or capital-intensive assets in the book with lower capital charges.

Inconsistent treatment: Identical instruments could be in different books across banks.



---

FRTB Framework (New Rules)

Clear rules:

Prescriptive criteria for what qualifies as trading book (e.g., held for short-term resale, profit from price changes).

Explicit list of instruments disallowed from trading book (e.g., unhedged credit loans).


Strict approval:

Switching between books requires regulatory approval.

Once reclassified, instruments can't be moved back for a year ("cooling-off" period).


Capital impact:

Switching leads to capital add-ons to discourage gaming the system.




---

Why It Matters

Reduces arbitrage between books.

Improves comparability and risk sensitivity across firms.

Encourages consistency in risk treatment across the industry.

Here’s a comparison of the Standardized Approach (SA) for market risk in the old Basel II framework vs the new FRTB Standardized Approach:


---

1. Risk Sensitivity

Aspect	Old SA (Basel II)	FRTB SA (New)

Sensitivity to risk	Low	High
Calculation basis	Not risk-factor based	Based on risk sensitivities (delta, vega, curvature)
Granularity	Broad categories	Granular buckets within each risk class



---

2. Risk Classes and Structure

Aspect	Old SA	FRTB SA

Risk categories	IR, FX, Equity, Commodity, Specific Risk	IR, Credit (non-securitized & securitized), FX, Equity, Commodity
Default risk	Embedded in generic risk weights	Separate Default Risk Charge (DRC)
Exotic risks	Often ignored or undercapitalized	Residual Risk Add-On (RRAO) captures complex risks



---

3. Methodology

Aspect	Old SA	FRTB SA

Position classification	By instrument type	By sensitivity to defined risk factors
Risk weight assignment	Fixed tables	Risk weights tied to risk buckets, adjusted by correlations
Correlation treatment	Often implicit or none	Explicit correlations used in aggregation formula



---

4. Capital Requirements

Aspect	Old SA	FRTB SA

Capital conservatism	In some cases underestimated risk	More conservative, especially for less liquid assets
Capital comparability	Poor across banks	Improved consistency across firms due to prescribed formula



---

Key Improvements in FRTB SA

Much more granular and risk-sensitive.

Better alignment with actual risk exposure.

Introduces systematic treatment of hedging and diversification.

Designed to be a viable alternative when IMA isn't approved.

Here's a detailed comparison of the Internal Models Approach (IMA) for market risk — Old (Basel II) vs New (FRTB):


---

1. Risk Measure

Aspect	Old IMA (Basel II)	FRTB IMA

Core metric	Value at Risk (VaR) at 99%, 10-day horizon	Expected Shortfall (ES) at 97.5%, liquidity horizon-based
Tail risk capture	Weak — VaR ignores tail beyond 99%	Strong — ES accounts for losses in the tail
Stress testing	Separate "Stressed VaR" add-on	Stress Period ES is integral to the model



---

2. Model Approval & Use

Aspect	Old IMA	FRTB IMA

Approval	At bank level	At desk level (each desk must be approved)
Model scope	Aggregated	Desk-by-desk approval and aggregation
Flexibility	More discretion in modelling	Stricter rules, validation, and backtesting



---

3. Risk Factor Treatment

Aspect	Old IMA	FRTB IMA

Risk factor eligibility	Loosely defined	Must meet data and liquidity criteria
Non-Modellable Risk Factors (NMRFs)	Not explicitly addressed	Explicit capital requirement for NMRFs
Liquidity	Uniform 10-day horizon	Risk-factor-specific liquidity horizons (10–120 days)



---

4. Testing & Governance

Aspect	Old IMA	FRTB IMA

Backtesting	Only daily VaR vs actual P&L	Backtesting + P&L Attribution (PLAT) required
PLAT	Not required	Mandatory – compares risk-theoretical vs hypothetical P&L
Failure impact	Warning & capital multiplier	Loss of IMA eligibility for that desk; must switch to SA



---

5. Capital Impact and Implications

Aspect	Old IMA	FRTB IMA

Capital outcomes	Potential underestimation	Generally more conservative & risk-sensitive
Implementation cost	Moderate	High – requires major infrastructure & data upgrades



---

Summary of Key Improvements in FRTB IMA

Better tail risk capture via Expected Shortfall

Risk-factor granularity with liquidity horizons

Desk-level approval ensures model relevance and accountability

PLAT and NMRFs improve accuracy and limit model overuse
