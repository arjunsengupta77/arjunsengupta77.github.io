Slide 1: Title Slide

Title:
Fundamentals of FRTB
Subtitle:
Understanding the Revised Market Risk Framework
Presented by: [Your Name]

Slide 2: Why FRTB?

Introduced as part of Basel III post-2008 crisis reforms.

Addresses weaknesses in market risk capital models.

Aims to fix inconsistencies between trading vs. banking books.

Replaces VaR with a more risk-sensitive metric: Expected Shortfall.

Objective: Improve risk comparability, consistency, and capture of tail risks.

Slide 3: Key Components of FRTB

Revised Trading Book Boundary: Clearer rules to avoid arbitrage.

Two Approaches:

Standardized Approach (SA) – rule-based, easier to implement.

Internal Models Approach (IMA) – advanced, but desk-level approval needed.


Non-Modellable Risk Factors (NMRFs):

Risk factors without sufficient data require conservative capital.




---

Slide 4: Standardized Approach (SA)

Sensitivities-Based Method: Capital based on delta, vega, and curvature.

Risk Classes: Interest Rates, Credit, FX, Equities, Commodities.

Default Risk Charge (DRC): Capital for jump-to-default events.

Residual Risk Add-On (RRAO): Captures risks in exotic trades.

SA is transparent, prescriptive, and easier for smaller firms.



---

Slide 5: Internal Models Approach (IMA)

Expected Shortfall replaces VaR – better tail risk capture.

Liquidity Horizons applied to each risk factor (10–120 days).

P&L Attribution (PLAT): Ensures models reflect trading desk performance.

Desk-Level Approval: Each desk must pass tests for IMA usage.

Desks failing tests default to SA – usually with higher capital.



---

Slide 6: Challenges & Wrap-Up

Challenges:

Data quality and volume requirements.

Operational and infrastructure upgrades.

Higher capital for desks not approved under IMA.


Wrap-Up:

FRTB is more than compliance—it's a shift in market risk management.

Aligns risk and front-office practices.

Encourages transparency and comparability across institutions.
